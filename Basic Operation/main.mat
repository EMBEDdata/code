%%%%%% The code performs several basic operations for manipulation and analysis of the data
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% data: the feature vector (last column is the label)
load data;

%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Removing the instances of a label from data
lbl = 12001; % removed label

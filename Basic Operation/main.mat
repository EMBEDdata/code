%%%%%% The code performs several basic operations for manipulation and analysis of the data
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% data: the feature vector file (last column is the label)
load data;
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Removing the instances of a label from data
lbl = 12001; % removed label
data(data(:,end-1)==lbl,:)=[];
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Plotting all the appliance signature (feature vectors) 
n = 8;
startVec = 1;
endVec = 202;
midVec = 41;
clusterPlot_v2(data(:,1:end-1),n,startVec,endVec,midVec)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Plotting only one label

lbl = 12901; % plotting a specific label appliance signature
n = 1;
startVec = 1;
endVec = 202;
midVec = 41;
clusterPlot_v2(data(data(:,end-1)==lbl,1:end-1),n,startVec,endVec,midVec)


%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Plotting the observation and event location of a specific label appliance signature
targetLbl = 12001;
temp= data(data(:,end-1)==targetLbl,:);
x=[1:202];

for i=1:size(temp,1)
    figure;
    plot(x, temp(i,1:202));
    hold on
    plot(41,temp(i,41),'rO')
    title(i);
    input('enter');
    close;
end


%% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Counting the observations of different labels
lbl1 = 14701; % label 1
lbl2 = 14702; % label 2

[cnt1,cnt2] = countLbl(data, lbl1, lbl2)

# EMBED

EMBED is a public dataset for electricty disaggregation. The data contains fully-labeled event timestamps in addition to ground truth consumption for a variety of appliances, making it suitable for perfomance evaluation of event-based and non-event-based algorithms.

A number of MATLAB codes are provided in this repository for basic analysis and visualization of the dataset.

# Description

`Automated Clustering/` includes the codes for the clustering. `Automated Clustering/main.mat` is the function for running the analysis.

`Basic Operation/`includes samples code for data manipulation.

`FeatureExtraction.mat`is used for extracting the appliance signaures from the labeled event timestamps based on user's customized parameters.

`SignatureVisualization.mat` is used for plotting the extracted feature vectors.
